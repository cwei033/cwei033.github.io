          <p>"Le Self Sandwich" is an art project done in collaboration with fellow San Jose State University students Aaron Chin, Jonathan Hsu, and Kyra SyCip. Using Adobe Illustrator, the four of us each created 6+ individual pieces which ultimately tessellate together to form an acrylic sandwich stand. The theme behind the project is as follows: "Your sandwich is a reflection of you, as in you are what you eat and if you were ever between two buns, that’s what you’d taste like. The purpose of this piece is to track what foods you’ve eaten throughout the course of a week. Any time you eat a food that contains ingredients found as pieces, you add them to your 'self sandwich.'"<br><br>
            Regarding our group's approach to the project, we decided to focus on the idea of sandwich-building due to Aaron's own recent obsession with sandwiches. For the design of our pieces, we decided to split the workload based on ingredient category after working together to compose and organize a list of common sandwich ingredients. For my pieces, I based my bread designs off of baguettes, brioches, and bagels. Along with that, I was also in charge of designing the plate bases since I was most familiar with the best-fitting dimensions of the bottom bread pieces. Regarding the schema design which I was also responsible for, I decided to base the look off of a burger joint menu I found through my research.
