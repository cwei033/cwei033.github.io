          <h2>MonoBoard</h2>
          <h3>Medium: Maya, Adobe Premiere Pro</h3>
          <h3>Year: 2020</h3>
          <h3>Dimension: 1920x1080p, 25 seconds</h3>

          <p>The construction of the animation took largely into consideration an effort to decrease rendering time, hence I tried to minimize the number of frames used as much as possible. I also tried to use simple textures and geometry, knowing
            that complex materials would dramatically increase the amount of time it takes to render a single frame. As it stands, the animation consists of 186 frames at 15fps. Even then, the render in total still took more than 9 hours to complete
            since the quality is 1080p. After render, the animation was then slowed down in Premiere Pro, both to introduce a dramatic tone as well as to length the video overall. In terms of subject, a Monopoly board game was chosen due to the fact
            that I thought it would be interesting to create an animation which would dramatize and darken the playing of the game, serving as a juxtaposition to a typical board game experience. The thought of having a shower of dice cascading down
            from the sky and bouncing off the board into oblivion also intrigued me.</p>
