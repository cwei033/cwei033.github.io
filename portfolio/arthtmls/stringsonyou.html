          <h2>Strings on You</h2>
          <h3>Medium: Maya</h3>
          <h3>Year: 2020</h3>
          <h3>Dimension: 1920x1080p</h3>
          <hr>
          <p>Taking inspiration from the article “POSTmatter: Holly Herndon interview,” I sought to create a scene in which technology seemingly has a life of its own. As such, I began by modeling Mac laptops and then attaching arms and legs to them. I also incorporated mouse-like shapes in the scene that were primarily influenced by Korean artist Jun Seo Hahm’s works. Then, using nCloth, I created red threads that wind around the entirety of the predominantly white scene. Along with serving as an accent and as a dedication to Chiharu Shiota's practice in which the element was also utilized, the red threads are also tied to the idea of the soul in Japanese legends, hence fitting into Strings on You’s theme of technological sentiency. In terms of the white palette, the choice stems primarily from my desire to step out of my usual dark color scheme which can most obviously be seen in "MonoBoard" and "The Cage".
