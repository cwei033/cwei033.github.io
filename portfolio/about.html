    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>I am a Taiwanese-American illustrator working in both digital and traditional format. Currently, I am an undergraduate at San Jose State University seeking to acquire a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree with a concentration in Digital Media Art. My
      primary medium of choice is Javascript, although I am also adept with Maya Software as well as other Adobe products. In terms of traditional media, I dabble in mediums such as charcoal, colored pencils, wire, et cetera. <br>
      My practice entails considering previously conceived concepts and reconstructing them in a new light, whether through the method of 3D modeling, 2D illustrations through Photoshop, Javascript, or through any other mediums I deem fit for the
      subject at hand. In reimagining old concepts, I call to attention intriguing works that have been created throughout the span of human existence and cater it to the modern audience. Typically, this journey of reinvention begins with a simple
      and sudden fascination with a recently discovered concept or skill set and an urge to incorporate this new discovery into my own practice. An instance of such proceedings can be seen through the conception process of my 3D animation, "Escape,"
      wherein during my everyday life, I casually stumbled upon an illustration of a pavilion in a garden drawn by Webtoon artist Domac. Upon setting my eyes on the illustration, I immediately knew I had to model the scene and include it in my work
      in some way, thus prompting the creation of "Escape" in which the pavilion is incorporated in the second environment of the animation. Another occurrence of my abrupt conception technique can be seen in the case of my virtual installation, "The
      Cage." While nonchalantly perusing through Youtubeâ€™s archive of content concerning Maya modeling, I discovered a video in which the uploader used a combination of NURBS curves extrusion and shift-duplication to create a standard birdcage.
      Fascinated by this skill of which I was previously unaware, I knew I wanted to try it out for myself and use it in one of my works, hence the origin of the blooms in "The Cage."
      <br>
      Through my artworks, I introduce a new narrative to concepts which are already known to most. Whether this entails rebuilding a 2D idea in 3D space or inserting the old concepts into a new scope of understanding depends on the circumstances. In
      theory, I tend to keep in the realm of fiction, drawing inspiration from fairytales and other subjects of whimsy and often inserting a dark spin to the material. In doing so, I hope to create a juxtaposition of concepts which stirs up people's
      interest while still keeping in a familiar light.
