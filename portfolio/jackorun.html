      Jack o' Run is a digital game created in collaboration with Amy Devorkin, with Devorkin as the programmer and myself as the artist. My responsibilites included finding audio as well as creating all the assets of the game. With this project being Devorkin's first attempt at programming, I suggested a simple 2D endless runner style game so as to not make the programming aspect too hard for her. The Halloween concept of the game comes from Devorkin and I's mutual love of the holiday. <br>In this 2D platformer game, the player runs through a neighborhood on Halloween night, jumping over pumpkins and collecting candy. The goal is to collect as much candy as you can before spending all three of your lives. Lives are spent when failing to jump over pumpkins.
